Calculating π using voxels in 3d space

demo https://codepen.io/MartianLord/full/qBRdKZw

So basically it divides 3d space into voxel, and count if that voxel is in a sphere, you can count it towards the volume.  
Once the volume is figured out, you can use reverse the standard sphere volume formula (4/3πr^3) to calculate π.
